# Operating Systems Linux Kernel Module Development

The following are the 3 different loadable kernel modules created as part of the course described in brief 

1. Computing CPU Time in the Kernel interfaced for user processes via ProcFS
2. Rate Monotonic Scheduler using Linux scheduler API for custom userspace processes
3. Kernel Page Fault Profiler that uses a shared virtual memory buffer for a userspace monitor process
